# Stock Market Data

### ðŸ“ˆ About ðŸ“ˆ

Stock Market Data is a simple web app that enables you to conduct real-time research on stocks. I try to work on my financial literacy in my spare time, and realized it would be fun to delve into this interest by making a web app somehow related to personal finance.

More importantly, the development of this web app is my foray into Node.js and back-end technologies. After embarking on my [#30Days30Projects](https://codepen.io/collection/DgGrjx) challenge and successfully learning how to make API calls, I figured that making this app would be the next logical step toward augmenting my tech stack. I followed [John Elder's](http://johnelder.org/) helpful tutorial, to which I owe my credit for this app's completion, as it absolutely pointed me in the right direction.

### ðŸ“ˆ How it works ðŸ“ˆ
You can visit the [live demo](https://stockmarketdata.herokuapp.com/) to search data on stocks by entering a [stock ticker](https://gretlcycu.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/quick-ticker-symbol-list.pdf) such as *DOW* in the search bar.
